==========

TODAY:
- finish DESeq tutorial
- make metadata table
- start looking at our data!
- prep for meeting
- MBSB lectures 3&4
- DESeq workflow mind map
- download and go over 220 slides

NOTES:
- tried to write a shell script for making metadata table
- using cut, sed, and paste turned out to be a better solution
	ex. cut -f1 -d- samplelist.file |
	sed -E 's/[0-9]+//' > strainlist.file
	- this creates a list of strains only
	- NB: when using sed with MacOSX, use -E instead of -r with sed
		- -r in linux turns on extended regex

NEXT:
- fix count table for mRNA in DESeq
- continue with blurb thoughts
- MBSB lectures 3&4
- maybe start with DESeq workflow map

TODAY:
- succeeded in running DESeq2 on mRNA data
	- tried strain & temp as variables
	- also tried strain & temp & replicate as variables
	- no DE seen when replicate included-->good sign
- went through DESeq2 tutorial up to end of pg. 10 ("identify()")
