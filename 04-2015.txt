==========

TODAY:
- finish DESeq tutorial
- make metadata table
- start looking at our data!
- prep for meeting
- MBSB lectures 3&4
- DESeq workflow mind map
- download and go over 220 slides

NOTES:
- tried to write a shell script for making metadata table
- using cut, sed, and paste turned out to be a better solution
	ex. cut -f1 -d- samplelist.file |
	sed -E 's/[0-9]+//' > strainlist.file
	- this creates a list of strains only
	- NB: when using sed with MacOSX, use -E instead of -r with sed
		- -r in linux turns on extended regex

NEXT:
- fix count table for mRNA in DESeq
- continue with blurb thoughts
- MBSB lectures 3&4
- maybe start with DESeq workflow map

==========

TODAY:
- succeeded in running DESeq2 on mRNA data
	- tried strain & temp as variables
	- also tried strain & temp & replicate as variables
	- no DE seen when replicate included-->good sign
- went through DESeq2 tutorial up to end of pg. 10 ("identify()")


17-04-2015
==========

TODAY:
- went through multi-factor section in DESeq2 manual
	- applied it to my data
	- the help page for "results" is especially helpful
	- changed temp and rep to factors from integers
	- resultsNames() shows all levels for comparison
	- to indicate an interaction, use ':' 
		> design(dds) = ~ group + condition + group:condition

UPDATE:
- continued working with DESeq2, generated some plots
- however, looks like it is not good with more complicated designs
- will now try edgeR
- also signed up for conference

TODAY:
- read a bit about edgeR
- learned some stats, signed up for a stats with R course on edX
- looked at JW document
- had variant calling tutorial 
	- should prep files with PICARD
	- see WW email for pipeline
- understood rationale for variant calling
	- potentially contaminated ED sample was already variant called using AF ref
	- I will call my mRNA sample with AF ref, see if it matches the ED genomic SNP analysis
- how I understand variant calling to work:	
	- map reads from a sample to the reference genome
	- identify sites for which there is more than one base at that position in the sequence
	- record the base that is at that position
- started the variant calling pipeline today
	- made reference indices
	- began PICARD ReorderSam
	- used some inline bash commands from WW:
		- for file in *.sorted.bam ; do PICARD ReorderSam R=~/*246.genomic.fa I=${file} O=${file/.sorted.bam/_reorder.bam} ; done
	- still running as of 16:48

NEXT:
- continue reading about edgeR and GLMs
- learn some more stats
- continue on variant calling pipeline
- figure out how to connect to work comp from home
- read paper for meeting
