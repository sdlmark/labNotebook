- email AM
- email JP
- find stats & programming tutorial
- read
- work on primer thing
- work on ED thing

READING:
- Anderson et al. 2013, Mol Ecol: 
	- looking at antagonistic pleiotropy vs. conditional neutrality in
	  local adaptation
	- antagonistic pleiotropy:
		- pleiotropy: one gene affects more than one trait
		- AP: one gene affects a trait that is detrimental and another
		  that is adaptive
		- AP in local adaptation: trait not favoured in foreign env;
		  maladaptive trait exposed
	- conditional neutrality:
		- alleles favoured in one env but neutral in another
	- many studies favour conditional neutrality hypothesis
		- but this may be an artifact 
	- developed a new protocol to distinguish AP from CN in QTLxE
	  interactions
	- RILs:
		- backcrossing hybrids to parent to create small part of one
		 parent's genome in the background of the other's
		- then phenotype these RILs to determine association of that
		  region with a particular trait
	- made a tool to analyse CN vs. AP: CNAP
		- generates null distributions of allele frequency if genotype
		  does not affect fitness
		- not really sure how it distinguishes bw CN and AP...

ED IDENTITY CRISIS:
	- bash script for getting bases with ALT and no indels (altlist.sh)
	$ for file in *uniGen* ; do bash altlist.sh $file ; done
	- automated it to run through all *uniGen* files
		- ED genomic: 454050 SNPs
		- HK genomic, B: 964805
		- HK genomic, D: 761531

NEXT:
- read about clustering
- continue with stuff

- thinking

READING:
- Liu & Si 2014, book chapter: Cluster Analysis of RNA-seq Data
	- microarray data is continuous and thus can be modeled with norm dist
	- RNA-seq data is discrete and right-skewed (many genes have low expr)
	- 2 methods: transform counts so they are closer to norm dist, or work
	  directly with data using appropriate distributions
		- 1st method: RPKM
			- scales counts for one gene in one rep one treat by
			  total counts for all genes in sample and the length
			  of the gene	
			- i.e. counts are scaled by sequencing depth and gene
			  length (2 factors of bias)
			- then log-transform
				- reduces skew; take log of both var
				- good for data that span several ord of mag
				- good for multiplicative data ex. change is
				  dependent on how much you start with
			- this makes data not discrete and closer to normal
			- can apply clustering methods for norm dist like
			  Euclidean distance, k-means clustering
		- 2nd method: applying discrete distributions (variance
		  stabilizing methods)
			- Poisson only estimates technical variance
			- Negative binomial is more flexible with variance
			  because of extra dispersion parameter that
			  incorporates biological variance
	- normalization of count data
		- involves estimating normalization factor that accounts for
		  biases like sequencing depth
		- DESeq: takes ratio of gene count and geometric mean, then
		  takes median
			- geometric mean: multiply all values then take the
			  root of the number of samples
		- edgeR: uses Trimmed Mean of M values
		- both are good
	- clustering
		- first take the mean of norm values over replicates for each
		  treatment
		- determine dissimilarity between samples
			- Euclidean distance: geometric distance (sum of
			  squares between 2 samples)
			- Pearson correlation (1 minus correlation)
			- both are sensitive to skew, might not be good for
			  non-normal data
			- therefore best used with transformed data i.e. RPKM
		- k-means
			- starts with k separate groups and assigning genes to
			  groups such that squared diff from mean is minimized
			- mean for each group calculated with addition of each
			  sample? (iterative; gets better and better)
			- should start from different randomizations several
			  times (first group assignment is random)
			- fast, but downside is k must be chosen first
			- diff algorithms may arrive at diff ks
			- perhaps run data with a variety of ks

PRIMER DESIGN: off the hook!

ED ID CRISIS:
- ED14-1: 141387
- ED14-2: 140173
- ED14-3: 153805
- ED20-1: 129461
- ED20-2: 165155
- ED20-3: 162319
- ED30-1: 158773
- ED30-2: 194446
- ED30-3: 159869
- edww: 454050
- hkb: 964805
- hkd: 761531
	- diff between hkb & hkd...important? prob should find out...
	- thankfully no. sites in mRNA are fewer than genomic!
