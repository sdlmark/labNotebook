READING:
- Anderson et al. 2013, Mol Ecol: 
	- looking at antagonistic pleiotropy vs. conditional neutrality in
	  local adaptation
	- antagonistic pleiotropy:
		- pleiotropy: one gene affects more than one trait
		- AP: one gene affects a trait that is detrimental and another
		  that is adaptive
		- AP in local adaptation: trait not favoured in foreign env;
		  maladaptive trait exposed
	- conditional neutrality:
		- alleles favoured in one env but neutral in another
	- many studies favour conditional neutrality hypothesis
		- but this may be an artifact 
	- developed a new protocol to distinguish AP from CN in QTLxE
	  interactions
	- RILs:
		- backcrossing hybrids to parent to create small part of one
		 parent's genome in the background of the other's
		- then phenotype these RILs to determine association of that
		  region with a particular trait
	- made a tool to analyse CN vs. AP: CNAP
		- generates null distributions of allele frequency if genotype
		  does not affect fitness
		- not really sure how it distinguishes bw CN and AP...

ED IDENTITY CRISIS:
	- bash script for getting bases with ALT and no indels (altlist.sh)
	$ for file in *uniGen* ; do bash altlist.sh $file ; done
	- automated it to run through all *uniGen* files
		- ED genomic: 454050 SNPs
		- HK genomic, B: 964805
		- HK genomic, D: 761531
