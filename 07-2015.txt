READING:
- Anderson et al. 2013, Mol Ecol: 
	- looking at antagonistic pleiotropy vs. conditional neutrality in
	  local adaptation
	- antagonistic pleiotropy:
		- pleiotropy: one gene affects more than one trait
		- AP: one gene affects a trait that is detrimental and another
		  that is adaptive
		- AP in local adaptation: trait not favoured in foreign env;
		  maladaptive trait exposed
	- conditional neutrality:
		- alleles favoured in one env but neutral in another
	- many studies favour conditional neutrality hypothesis
		- but this may be an artifact 
	- developed a new protocol to distinguish AP from CN in QTLxE
	  interactions
	- RILs:
		- backcrossing hybrids to parent to create small part of one
		 parent's genome in the background of the other's
		- then phenotype these RILs to determine association of that
		  region with a particular trait
	- made a tool to analyse CN vs. AP: CNAP
		- generates null distributions of allele frequency if genotype
		  does not affect fitness
		- not really sure how it distinguishes bw CN and AP...

ED IDENTITY CRISIS:
	- bash script for getting bases with ALT and no indels (altlist.sh)
	$ for file in *uniGen* ; do bash altlist.sh $file ; done
	- automated it to run through all *uniGen* files
		- ED genomic: 454050 SNPs
		- HK genomic, B: 964805
		- HK genomic, D: 761531

READING:
- Liu & Si 2014, book chapter: Cluster Analysis of RNA-seq Data
	- microarray data is continuous and thus can be modeled with norm dist
	- RNA-seq data is discrete and left-skewed (many genes have low expr)
	- 2 methods: transform counts so they are closer to norm dist, or work
	  directly with data using appropriate distributions
		- 1st method: RPKM
			- scales counts for one gene in one rep one treat by
			  total counts for all genes in sample and the length
			  of the gene	
			- i.e. counts are scaled by sequencing depth and gene
			  length (2 factors of bias)
			- then log-transform
				- reduces skew; take log of both var
				- good for data that span several ord of mag
				- good for multiplicative data ex. change is
				  dependent on how much you start with
			- this makes data not discrete and closer to normal
			- can apply clustering methods for norm dist like
			  Euclidean distance, k-means clustering
		- 2nd method: applying discrete distributions (variance
		  stabilizing methods)
			- Poisson only estimates technical variance
			- Negative binomial is more flexible with variance
			  because of extra dispersion parameter that
			  incorporates biological variance
	- normalization of count data
		- involves estimating normalization factor that accounts for
		  biases like sequencing depth
		- DESeq: takes ratio of gene count and geometric mean, then
		  takes median
			- geometric mean: multiply all values then take the
			  root of the number of samples
				- good for describing central tendencies of
				  things with different orders of magnitude
		- edgeR: uses Trimmed Mean of M values
		- both are good
	- clustering
		- first take the mean of norm values over replicates for each
		  treatment
		- determine dissimilarity between samples
			- Euclidean distance: geometric distance (sum of
			  squares between 2 samples)
			- Pearson correlation (1 minus correlation)
			- both are sensitive to skew, might not be good for
			  non-normal data
			- therefore best used with transformed data i.e. RPKM
		- k-means
			- starts with k separate groups and assigning genes to
			  groups such that squared diff from mean is minimized
			- mean for each group calculated with addition of each
			  sample? (iterative; gets better and better)
			- should start from different randomizations several
			  times (first group assignment is random)
			- fast, but downside is k must be chosen first
			- diff algorithms may arrive at diff ks
			- perhaps run data with a variety of ks

PRIMER DESIGN: off the hook!

ED ID CRISIS:
- ED14-1: 141387
- ED14-2: 140173
- ED14-3: 153805
- ED20-1: 129461
- ED20-2: 165155
- ED20-3: 162319
- ED30-1: 158773
- ED30-2: 194446
- ED30-3: 159869
- edww: 454050
- hkb: 964805
- hkd: 761531
	- diff between hkb & hkd...important? prob should find out...
	- thankfully no. sites in mRNA are fewer than genomic!

NEXT:
- think about how to compile these data into a fasta file			


06-07-2015
==========

TODAY:
- go over cluster notes; read more
- r tutorial
- work on ED ID (python dictionary refresh)
- look at Tophat/Mazurka ref from AC
- investigate GOrilla

READING: Liu & Si Cluster Analysis continued
	- Hierarchical Clustering
		- groups items based on dissimilarity; least dissimilar groups
		  go together
		- produces a tree
		- agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive: agg starts with
		  indivduals and works up to whole data set
		- hierarchical performs well with RNA-seq data; so does agg
		  (div is too comp intensive)
		- more flexible than k-means because different levels of tree
		  give different number of k (ex. higher = fewer groups)
		- best way to define dissimilarity is with average linkage
			- considers all data points, more consistent
	- NB: previous methods do well with data that are continuous/normally distributed
	- Clustering count data
		- RNA-seq data not norm dist, genes with low/no counts makes
		  problems for log transform
		- Poisson Dissimilarity
			- usually for sample-based clustering (LRT bw vectors)
		- Model-based clustering
			- use expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to
			  estimate model parameters
			- should be initialized (improves performance)
			- negative binomial requires an extra dispersion
			  parameter be estimated for each gene
			- to choose number k partitions, use AIC, where lower
			  AIC indicates a better model
		- Hybrid-Hierarchical clustering
			- combo of hierarchical and model-based
			- hierarchical is good because you don't have to be
			  strict with choosing a k
			- however, it's too comp intensive; so combined with
			  model-based methods
			- k clusters chosen with model-based methods,
			  clustering performed with hierarchical methods
	- try HH clustering with MBCluster.Seq package
		- steps outlined in chapter

NOTES:
- decided to try re-analysing mRNA data with DESeq
- if I'm already using DESeq to normalize data, maybe I should be consistent
	- it looks like it might be complicated...
- anyway, it was suggested in that clustering chapter that I only use counts
  for genes for which there is DE
	- also, you are supposed to use counts as they are i.e. not normalized
	- so maybe just get the raw counts for genes with DE sig int from edgeR 
	  and try to cluster those
- attempting to use MBCluster.Seq
	- ran into a problem at Cluster.RNASeq step...
	- try from the beginning with only DE sig int raw gene counts
	- trying multiple things:
		- eliminating row names-->nope
		- read in data as.matrix instead of as.data.frame-->nope :(
- argh! this is frustrating. I need to find more software for clustering
	- WW says just normalize with RPKM and compare patterns but I don't
	  know if this is solid
		- what if you thought it was increasing across all temps but
		  the increase between 20 and 30 was small? I think you need
		  statistics...

NEXT:
- try mfuzz 
- get on ED ID!
- email GD
- AC meeting
- check out clustering stuff on Bioconductor
- think (ex. about what I want these data to tell me)


07-07-2015
==========

TODAY:
- email GD
- try mfuzz
- read
- look at Bioconductor clustering stuff
- AC meeting:
	- SNP idea?
	- PhD transfer process-->meeting?
	- skills goals

THOUGHTS:
- contrast SNP location & number among effect groups?
- would expect SNPs in temp effect only genes to be coding, synonymous, very
  low number
	- because there is no diff in genotype in response to temp
- would expect more SNPs in genotype effect only genes, perhaps coding and
  nonsynonymous
	- because there is diff in genotype response regardless of temp
- would expect SNPs in GxE genes to be in regulatory regions, like upstream,
  5' and 3', splice sites, introns
	- because response depends on genotype and temp

READING: soft clustering software for microarray data
	- Kumar & Futschik 2007, Bioinformation:
		- using soft clustering, genes can belong to different
		  clusters
		- supposedly improves robustness to noise and identification
		  of regulatory regions (microarray data is supposedly
		  inherently noisy)
		- mfuzz uses fuzzy c-means algorithm
		- has graded cluster membership (from 0 to 1) as opposed to
		  all or nothing (0 or 1) as in hard clustering (k-means)
		- thus you can see which genes have the strongest association
		  to a cluster, cluster cores are defined by strength
		- you have to choose the number of clusters and the
		  fuzzification parameter, m
- how to select a value for the fuzzification parameter, m:
	- Dembele & Kastner 2003, Bioinformatics:
		- too mathy for me at the moment...

NOTES:
- plan to normalize counts by RPKM seems complicated...
	- involves using Cuffquant and Cuffnorm in Cufflinks
- just do it on my own in R?

MEETING:
- should aim for 5-7 chapters in PhD
- to stay on track:
	- make lists of what you want to include in a paper
		- ex. what figures? how can you make these figures? what do
		  you need to do?
		- what conclusions? what do you need to do in order to arrive
		  at these conclusions?
- trying to move more towards more substantial papers
	- involve a significant contribution to knowledge about biology &
	  evolution etc.
- mRNA & small RNA probably would count for 2 chapters
- SNPs would most likely be in non-coding regions
	- can 5' UTR be distinguished in gff?
- re receipt: print reimbursement form, get AC signature
- GxE and small RNA are what are special about these data


08-07-2015
==========

TODAY:
- email NP, SW re transfer meeting
- think about meeting document
- AM lab meeting
- begin script for ED ID
- stats in R class
- look into rlog() in DESeq2


NOTES:
- GWAS: looking at individuals from wild to associate genotype with phenotype
	- assumes lots of recombination
	- more or less random combos of genes
- RILs & NILs
	- isolating genotypes


09-07-2015
==========

TODAY:
- read
- meet with potential undergrad
- script for ED ID
- stats in R
- ask about work study pay

NOTES:
- making dictionaries for ED ID:	
	- keys need to be unique! so if you use chrom as a key, you only get a
	  handful of keys
	- using pos is better but not good enough because the there are
	  identical pos on different chrom
	- possibly: could amalgamate chrom and pos into a single character
		- ex. {I_1453:('T', 'A')}
