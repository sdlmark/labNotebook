- think about what kinds of things can be extracted from sig int lists
- email RG edgeR notes
- talk to W about SNP neighbour network
- research clustering methods
- find out how to get a table of normalized counts from edgeR/DESeq
	- cannot use normalized count table from edgeR
		- adjusts library size to normalize gene 'abundance' across
		  samples
	- sizeFactors() in DESeq transforms raw reads so they can be compared 
		- ~/AFHK.mrna.counts.table 
- genes with significant interaction:
	- on chrom I: 893
	- on chrom II: 1014
	- on chrom III: 755
	- on chrom IV: 964
	- on chrom V: 1378
	- on chrom X: 938
	- do chi-square test? prob not...
- also counted exons per gene of genes with sig int, separated by chromosome
	- problem! numbers do not add up...
	- *random = 30
	- un = 90
	- still missing 700 genes! 
		- might have to do with grep pattern; only grabs multiples
		- try: grep " II \| II" tomorrow

NEXT:
- re-run DE analysis without HK30-3; compare results
- redo test for main effects on genes without interaction
- find out how to do GO analysis
- talk to W re SNP neighbour network
- visualize exon stuff


19-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- redo test for main effects without sig interaction genes
	- see if there is a difference in numbers, genes
- what is GO analysis?
- re-count exon stuff!!
	- make sure they add up to 6267!
	- chrom I: 935
	- chrom II: 1043
	- chrom III: 783
	- chrom IV: 993
	- chrom V: 1421
	- chrom X: 968
	- un: 94
	- *random: 30 
	- woohoo! it adds up
- wait: *random means that it comes from a fragment that belongs somewhere on
  the chromosome, but not sure precisely where
	- recount to include random
		- I: 935 (no random)
		- II: 1043 (no random)
		- III: 795
		- IV: 994
		- V: 1437
		- X: 969
		- un: 94
- test for main effects among genes that are not significant for interaction
	- make a subset of genes that includes only those that did not show
	  interaction
		- how to do this in R?
	- make a new model that does not contain the interaction
	- test for strain, temp
	- is the list the same? should find more genes...
		- way more genes! this can't be true...
		- main effect strain: 4188
		- main effect temp: 5285
- visualize exon stuff
	- per chromosome, what is the distribution of exon number?

NEXT:

22-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- look at HR's emails; email HR
- email W re SNP neighbour network
- reading schedule
- read
- think of what to do with sig int list
	- classify further?
	- what sorts of things do people measure re genes in genomes
- reread JC paper
- talk to MG re subsetting in R

READING:
- try reading 2 papers per day
	- one for methods & exptl design
	- one review (for concepts)
- METHODS: clustering gene expr patterns
	- Thomas et al. 2014, G3:
		- characterizing gene expr along Dm gut
		- clustered via fuzzy-c means, with prog MFuzz
			- plots are norm counts (FPKM?) vs. gut section
		- does not say what sample size was
			- perhaps used clustering a/o DE because no reps
- REVIEW: inferring evo gene reg from inter sp comp.
	- Romero et al. 2012, NatRevGen:
		- try to identify genes undergoing stabilizing, directional
		  sel
		- look for genes that have low var within sp, high var btw
			- potential target for dir sel
		- however could also be explained by sp env diff
		- diff tissues show diff kinds sel
		- no strong evidence for effect of alt spli on inter sp gene
		  reg (at least in primates)
		- can only make correlations between reg elements (ex. TFs,
		  H3K4me3, miRNAs) and gene expr levels
- make shortlist of papers to read soon:
	- finish review from today
	- Llinas 2006 (WGT Plasmodium)
	- Stapely 2010 (Adaptation genomics)
	- Whitehead & Crawford 2006 (Var gene expr)
	- Landry 2005 (Compensatory cis-trans reg hybrids Dm)


23-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- read
- review JC paper
- prep for meeting
- look at sig DE data

READING:
- REVIEW: inferring evo gene reg from inter sp comp. cont'd.
	- Romero et al. 2012, NatRevGen:
		- very difficult to establish causal relationship bw change in
		  gene reg and phenotype
		- can only be validated through experimentation
		- some examples of disruption of upstream region resulting in
		  phenotype
		- this review mainly focused on primates
- METHODS: characterizing gene expr & inferring reg in Dm at different temps
	- Chen, Nolte & Schlotterer 2015, MBE:
		- wanted to understand gene expr plasticity with temp
		- classified reaction norms for Dm at 4 temp
		- identified 3 components of plasticity: sum of change
		  (magnitude?), direction (up or down), curvature (lin v quad)
		- chose 5 reg factors; tested how well they predicted 3
		  measures of plasticity

MEETING:
- adaptive phenotype could be result of genes that show effect of strain only
  but not temp only (these are plastic and would have had their expr patterns
defined prior to local adaptation to different environments)
- list of genomic things to look at and collect data about
- identify which genes with main effects have main effects in both strain &
  temp


24-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- read
- make list of tasks & how they connect
	- add: count how many DE genes have SNPs
	- add: what proportion of DE genes have regulatory function (TFs,
	  small RNA)   
- work on ED ID

READING:
- REVIEW: critique of claim that morpho adaptation happens via cis-reg evolution
	- Hoekstra & Coyne 2007, Evolution:
		- define regulatory mutations as those that happen in noncoding
		  regions; mut in coding = structural
		- empirical evidence does not show direct link between
		  genotype and phenotype, focuses on loss of function
		- most mutations that lead to adaptive phenotypes are in
		  coding regions (admit ascertainment bias)
		- other things operate in a modular fashion, not just gene reg
		  (ex. gene duplication, alt spli); can also mitigate
		  pleiotropic effects
		- important! just because something is likely to be
		  subject to weaker selection doesn't mean it will fix faster;
		  also depends on likelihood that mutation will occur, and its
		  selection coefficient 

NOTES:
- re-did analysis of genes with no sig interaction:
	- see noint_maineffect_test.R
	- genes with main effect strain: 4188
	- genes with main effect temp: 5285
	- genes with main effect strain & temp: 2674
	- genes with main effect strain only: 1514

==========

TODAY:
- read 
- go to career centre
- email JP
- prop sig DE genes plots for main effects
- future map

READING:
- REVIEW: how HT data are helping identify cis-reg effects on phenotypic var
	- Pastinen 2010, NatRevGen:
		- gave a brief description of what allele-spec expr is and why
		  it's important
		- can uncover cis-reg activity among genotypes that show sim
		  amounts of expr (gives ex of negative feedback)
		- other than that, mostly talks about methods and results in
		  humans
- REVIEW: how NGS can help identify genes underlying adaptation
	- Stapley et al. 2010, TREE:
		- focus is mainly on non-model organisms
		- NGS can detect loci of small effect better than QTL mapping
		- can also identify loci of adaptation, structural variation
		- can address source of adaptive variation
		- good list of interesting papers

NOTES:
- command for finding matching genes from list of sig genes, counting exons
  and listing chromosome:
$ while read line ; do exons=`grep -c $line ~/*exon.gff3` ; chrom=`grep $line
~/*exon.gff3 | awk '{print $1}' -` ; echo $line $exons $chrom ; done <
strain_eff.list | less

	- I: 201 + 3 = 204
	- II: 216 + 8 = 224
	- III: 200 + 1 = 201
	- IV: 228 + 8 = 236

26-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- talk to KL re decision deadline
- email HR
- READING:
- REVIEW: 
	- Wray 2007, NatRevGen:
		- not productive to focus on how many reg vs. coding mutations
		  affect phenotype, rather focus on how the consequences are
		  qualitatively different
		- cis-regs more likely to result in certain phenotypes?
			- ex. dynamic phntp that change with time
		- selection acts differently on cis-reg mutations?
			- cis-reg are allele-spec, so sel acts on
			  heterozygotes; not as many coding mut are all-spec
			- modular nature of cis-reg means that phntp of mut
			  can be localized in space & time; coding mut affect
			  all proteins everywhere

NOTES:
- VCF processing:
	- make alignments (FASTA) of sites for which there are ALTs in at
	  least one of HK or ED references
		- should have AF, ED, HK, and ED samples aligned
	- choose alignment program
	- try: get a list of sites (positions) at which there is at least one
	  ALT in ED or HK
	- get base at that position for all vcfs: ALT, if none, REF
	- align with alignment program
	- feed alignment to splitstree
	- analyse tree

NEXT:
- meet with career counsellor
- meet with AC
- start VCF processing
- read
- read clustering pdf
- think about what might go into a paper
	- description-->what?
	- functional inference?
	- small RNA stuff? 


29-06-2015
==========
- think about cc meeting
- start vcf processing
- read
- read about clustering
- ideas
- ask KL about deadline
	- deadline is early August (Aug 15)
	- I have to give another committee meeting!

TODAY:
- processing vcfs for splitstree:
	- pasted vcfs from WW, got ones that have ALT in at least one sample
	- not working! resulting list seems to be truncated
		- nothing past chrI!
		- without indels, 2336108
		- witn indels, 2677181
	- talked to WW, says I should only get sites where there is info for
	  all samples
	- new approach:
		- identify bases in ED3092 which are not indels and have an
		  ALT--> 454050 bases
		- use this list to grab bases in other vcfs that are also not
		  indels and have ALTs 
		- keep doing this for each sample until there is a whittled
		  down list of sites at which all samples have ALT & no indel
		$ grep -v \## ED3092Nai_RiCr2_ploidy1.vcf | cut -f1,2,4,5 - |
		  awk '{if(length($3)==1 && length($4)==1) print $0}' - |
		  awk '$4!="." - > edww.snp.list
	- PROBLEM!
		- it's the space! 'chrI 574' is not working with grep
		- crap. WW says I have to write a script :(	

NEXT:
- redo python dictionary exercise
- look at nested dictionaries
- read
- think about meeting
- make files for dictionary making


30-06-2015
==========

MEETING:
- DE chrom graph: 
	- express as counts
	- maybe don't stack
- re PhD:
	- willing to have a mix of projects in order to learn a variety of
	  computational skills
	- discussed workshop attendance, visiting other universities
	- not a fan of co-advisory
	- should attend lab meetings of other groups
	- PhD is about learning how to learn-->focus on gaining independence
	- make a list of specific skills I want to learn
		- what types of data?
		- what approaches?
	- statistical genetics class
		- what other sorts of things do I want to learn?
- re mRNA data set:
	- to work on wrapping it up:	
		- think of relevant ways to describe the data
		- then think about connecting the things observed (ex. GxE
		  genes with polymorphism in promoters, dN/dS)

NOTES:
- re selecting genes for designing primers
	- you want to design primers that bind to orthologous genes in 2
	  species, but you want these genes to be of different length to be
	  able to distinguish them via gel electrophoresis
	- so you should look for genes in which the exons are the same between
	  species, but the intron length is different
	- the difference in intron lengths should be at least 100 bp
	  different because any smaller is hard to see on a gel
	- for a simple first pass, consider only the difference between first
	  introns of genes
	- also, you need to retain information about which exons are involved
	  because these are what the primers will ultimately bind to
	- apparently, when the gff says mRNA it includes introns?

TOMORROW:
- start list of skills
- email AM
- email JP
- work on primer thing
- do python dict exercise
