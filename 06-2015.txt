	- identify genes with significant main effect of strain
	- identify genes with significant main effect of temperature

16-06-2015
==========

MEETING:
- variant calling
	- make a neighbour network using SNPs
	- ask W

	- looking at F1s to reveal expression biases
- visualize results of edgeR

		- genes with sig strain & temp: 1051
		- genes with no sig at all: 2244


17-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- visualize edgeR results 
	- RG says not to bother dividing sig int
	- rather, increase FDR and see if the genes with no sig int at all
	  decreases
	- genes with sig int, FDR 0.1: 7909
		- genes with sig strain: 2684
		- genes with sig temp: 4309
		- genes with sig strain & temp: 1577
		- genes with no sig at all: 2493
	- genes with sig int, FDR 0.15: 9179
		- genes with sig strain: 3413
		- genes with sig temp: 5248
		- genes with sig strain & temp: 2072
		- genes with no sig at all: 2590
	- genes with sig int, FDR 0.2: 10166
		- genes with sig strain: 4101
		- genes with sig temp: 6059
		- genes with sig strain & temp: 2523
		- genes with no sig at all: 2529
- think about overarching q

NEXT:
- send edgeR notes to RG
- think about making some graphs...
	- ex. exon number? gene length?
- ask W about SNP neighbour network method
- read up on FDRs
- read up on clustering (k-means, fuzzy-c)


18-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- read about FDR
- email PT
- think about what kinds of things can be extracted from sig int lists
- email RG edgeR notes
- talk to W about SNP neighbour network
- research clustering methods
- find out how to get a table of normalized counts from edgeR/DESeq
	- cannot use normalized count table from edgeR
		- adjusts library size to normalize gene 'abundance' across
		  samples
	- sizeFactors() in DESeq transforms raw reads so they can be compared 
		- ~/AFHK.mrna.counts.table 
- genes with significant interaction:
	- on chrom I: 893
	- on chrom II: 1014
	- on chrom III: 755
	- on chrom IV: 964
	- on chrom V: 1378
	- on chrom X: 938
	- do chi-square test? prob not...
- also counted exons per gene of genes with sig int, separated by chromosome
	- problem! numbers do not add up...
	- *random = 30
	- un = 90
	- still missing 700 genes! 
		- might have to do with grep pattern; only grabs multiples
		- try: grep " II \| II" tomorrow

NEXT:
- re-run DE analysis without HK30-3; compare results
- redo test for main effects on genes without interaction
- find out how to do GO analysis
- talk to W re SNP neighbour network
- visualize exon stuff


19-06-2015
==========

TODAY:
- redo test for main effects without sig interaction genes
	- see if there is a difference in numbers, genes
- what is GO analysis?
- re-count exon stuff!!
	- make sure they add up to 6267!
	- chrom I: 935
	- chrom II: 1043
	- chrom III: 783
	- chrom IV: 993
	- chrom V: 1421
	- chrom X: 968
	- un: 94
	- *random: 30 
	- woohoo! it adds up
- wait: *random means that it comes from a fragment that belongs somewhere on
  the chromosome, but not sure precisely where
	- recount to include random
		- I: 935 (no random)
		- II: 1043 (no random)
		- III: 795
		- IV: 994
		- V: 1437
		- X: 969
		- un: 94
- test for main effects among genes that are not significant for interaction
	- make a subset of genes that includes only those that did not show
	  interaction
		- how to do this in R?
	- make a new model that does not contain the interaction
	- test for strain, temp
	- is the list the same? should find more genes...
		- way more genes! this can't be true...
		- main effect strain: 4188
		- main effect temp: 5285
- visualize exon stuff
	- per chromosome, what is the distribution of exon number?

NEXT:
- think about direction: what do I want to do next?
	- ex. position? classification of proteins?
	- think about big q; what is important?
- get lists of stats for sig main effects
- make a reading list!
	- make a schedule
- talk to W about SNP neighbour network
- find out how to get GO terms: ex. interpro
