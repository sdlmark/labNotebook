==========

TODAY:
- try running HTSeq with parameters that make sense on an AF20 sample
	- first make a sorted bam file for AF20-2.Aligned.bam
		$ samtools sort -n AF20-2.Aligned.bam AF20-2.sorted 2>AF20-2.sorting.err
	$ htseq-count
	--format=bam
	--stranded=yes
	--mode=intersection-nonempty
	--idattr=Parent
	--type=exon
	AF20.sorted.bam
	~/c_briggsae.WBonly.gff3 
	> AF20-2.countWB.test
	2>AF20.2.countWB.err
	** yields 11769 genes with a non-zero count**
	** compare to same parameters on AF14-1: yielded 11496**
	** "Pseudogene" matches at beginning**
- made file countNotes.txt to keep track of parameters and results
- there are ~2.0*10^4 genes in C. briggsae
- it seems that many, many reads are not being counted...not sure why
	- try to find parameters that minimize the number of reads with
	  no_feature
	- perhaps try different modes (i.e. union, intersection-empty)
- continued with bash script tutorial
	- how to get input data from user:
		- command line argument (best for most scenarios-->can see in history
		- read -p (good for sensitive info; not stored)
		- redirected via STDIN (for piping, processing data)

NEXT:
- fill out countNotes.txt with results from new tests with different
  parameters
- continue with bash script tutorial
- make a bash script to automate sorting bam files
- read Git tutorial suggested by Jeremy


03-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- looked at preliminary data for different parameters in HTSeq (using R)
	- looks like data might not be stranded after all...
- Meeting:
	- receipts say that the reads are stranded...
	- but counts for stranded runs seem off...
	- find out what's going on! are reads stranded? what is HTSeq doing?!


04-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- figure out whether the reads are stranded
- figure out what is going on with HTSeq--how does it actually work?
- doesn't look like STAR has any options for strandedness (not an issue)
- trying to look at an alignment in IGV...
	- only takes indexed BAM files?
	- BAM files can only be indexed when not sorted by name?
- Wei thinks that most of the reads should be reversed
	- due to RT-PCR
	- try --stranded=reverse again, but with an exon-only gff
		- much more success with this!
- the high degree of ambiguity may be due to genes that use the same exons
	- denoted in the gff as "CBG:12345a" etc.
	- running HTSeq again with these exons omitted to see how much these
	  are biasing the ambiguity count
		- result decreases ambiguity, and in the case of the forward
		  stranded condition, greatly! (only 14 ambiguous counts!)
	- however, can't leave them out completely!
		- at first I thought that it was randomly assigning the most
		  reads to the "a" variant, but this is not the case
		- some transcripts are very different (CBG19793) and only have
		  a few exons in common
		- so I'm not sure what the benefit to leaving them out might
		  be...
		- 889 exons belong to more than one gene
		- 122448 exons are not shared
- also trying mRNA + reverse
	- perhaps this can avoid the ambiguity problem since they seem unique
	- there are some variants, but fewer in the mRNA + forward counts
	- looks good; about as good as exon + reverse
	- ambiguity might just be proportional and scale with mRNA...
	- looks like 83 mRNA transcripts have more than one variant

NEXT:
- look at genes that were counted in the mRNA + reverse condition
- try to figure out which would be the best parameters to use, which make the
  most sense
- continue with bash script tutorials
- talk to Asher about summer student
- email links to summer student


05-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- Wei made another gff that ignores splicing variants
- said it was not a good idea to use mRNA only...not completely sure why
- seems acceptable to run exon + reverse with WBexon_only.gff3
- write a bash script that automates that
- trying to pipe samtools stdout to htseq so that I don't have to create extra
  sorted files (and store them)
	- doesn't appear to work...the temporary BAM files don't merge
	- will probably have to sort them separately
- working on making a bash script to automate 
	- learned how to iterate through files in a folder
	#!/bin/bash
	folder=$1
	for file in $folder; do echo $file*; done

NEXT:
- finish bash script for automating samtools sort -n
- run said script
- start bash script for automating htseq with exon + reverse


10-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- prepare for meeting
	- what have I done so far regarding HTSeq?
- email H regarding Linux emulator
- compare exon-only reverse with exon-only not stranded
	- same genes being expressed? 
	- same genes being expressed to same degree?
	- perhaps try to concatenate into one file that you can look at in R

MEETING:
- go with reverse/not-stranded with exon-only gff
- look into parallelization
	- package for python/bash?
	- run several files through the same step at the same time
- Ne is basically a measure of the potential strength of drift
- classical pop gen assumes that any site is only biallelic
	- i.e. one allele is the mutant and the other is ancestral
	- this is also conditional on an infinite-sites model (each site can
	  only experience one mutation)
- triallelic sites are rare, but exist
	- their presence depends on either a high mutation rate or a large Ne
	  (or both)
- continue to think about why reverse while moving on with HTSeq

NEXT:
- compare exon-only reverse with exon-only not stranded; look for expression
- email H regarding Linux emulator
- bash scripting
- python parallelization
	- ask Wei?


11-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- compare exon-only reverse & exon-only not stranded
- find Linux emulator for H
- begin bash script for automating samtools sort
- do SWC homework

NOTES:
- seems to be more variation for Pseudogenes
- counts for some exons more variable than others
	- CBG00001: NS=968, Rev=970
		- exon has 2 copies; both on + strand
	- CBG00003: NS=205, Rev=206
		- exon has 5 copies; all on + strand
	- CBG00015: NS=24, Rev=8
		- exon has 3 copies; all on - strand
	- CBG00036: NS=70, Rev=62
		- exon has 7 copies; all on + strand
- concatenate files, search for exons that have large difference in count
	- are they all on - strand?
- simple commands to make table:
	- concatenate files by column:
		$ paste file1.txt file2.txt > newfile.txt
	- remove 3rd column from concatenated file:
		$ cut -f1,2,4 newfile.txt > cutfile.txt
	- remove last 5 lines from cut file:
		$ head -n -5 cutfile.txt > tablefile.txt
- 2028 exons have a count difference greater than 10 between NS and Rev
	- list in bigdiff.txt
- 1912 exons have a greater than 10 counts in NS than Rev
- find out what strand these exons are on...
- FYI exon list is identical for NS and Rev (23298) 
- made a bash script (~/scripts/bashtest.sh) for sorting bam files using
  samtools
	- started running it on ~/AF16/starAF16/alignsAF16/bam/ @ 16:09


12-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- sorted bam files from yesterday's script look good
- check out exons that have a large difference in non-stranded vs. reverse
- start writing bash script for automating HTSeq
	- non-stranded or reverse? what explains this?

NOTES:
- finished a potentially working copy of autohtseq.sh that should be ready to
  run
- determined strandedness of exons with big differences (strandtest.sh)
	- mix of - and +

NEXT:
- quantify how many are + and how many are -; how many exons they have
- look at these exons on WormBase
	- any unusual characteristics?
	- any commonalities?
- once satisfied about non-stranded/reverse-stranded situation, run
  autohtseq.sh
- run the sorting script on HK104, ED3092


13-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- wrote autobam.sh to automate conversion of SAM to BAM files
	- running it on HK104 and ED3092 aligns
	- finished converting this afternoon
- tried to write a script to quantify exons and orientation...
	- thinking perhaps it would be better to start with a better data file
	  format
	- otherwise, might try reading lines into a single array to make it
	  easier to work with
	- currently, the problem is trying to iterate between exonIDs rather
	  than one line at a time
- fixed the above problem by adjusting strandtest.sh
	- made a functional copy of strandsort.py
	- desired version of data file is in /sorttest/diffexondircount.txt
		- gives gene name, orientation, exon count
- there are roughly equal numbers of +/- genes that show a big difference
  between NS and Rev (977/1049)

NEXT:
- figure out whether to use reverse or non-stranded in HTSeq, depending on
  this new info


16-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- figure out whether to use non-stranded or reverse
	- look at stats for exons with large count differences
	- think about what makes the most sense...
	- ask W/confirm with him
- start running autohtseq on all strains
- whoops, HK and ED have been converted to BAM but have not been sorted
	- began at ~14:00
- aim to finish running HTSeq by tomorrow morning to be able to look at them
  tomorrow

NOTES:
- talked to R about mRNA folding--> apparently it does!
	- apparently, this is part of what makes identifying miRNAs so hard
	- suggested I check the gff for miRNA annotation
	- learned about mirtrons: miRNAs that take up a whole intron
	- suggested I think more about the questions I want to answer with the
	  data
- there are annotations for miRNA, but no other small RNA...
	- will have to look at some papers, ex. Shi et al. to see how they did
	  it
- thought more about strandedness, etc.
	- posted on SeqAnswers; quick response!
	- wondering if maybe they just chose the strand that was selected for
	  amplification was the reverse
	- have better understanding of forward vs. reverse genes
		- a gene is considered to be '+' if its pre-mRNA sequence is
		  identical to the forward/non-coding strand
			- it is '+' because it is SENSE to the forward strand
		- a gene is considered to be '-' if its pre-mRNA sequence is
		  identical to the reverse complement/template/coding strand
			- it is '-' because it is ANTISENSE to the forward
			  strand
- based on the fact that the SeqAnswers person said that strandedness
  reveals overlapping genes, I think that the genes that show big differences
between NS and Rev may be overlapping
	- might be interesting to check...
	- sorted according to difference, checked a few
	- some are located in regions with overlapping genes
	- some are located very close to other genes
	- some are just one gene but have huge exons??
	- one very cool one: CBG08438, CBG08439, CBG08436
		- last two are located in introns of first on opposite strand!


17-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- respond on SeqAnswers
- yesterday: finished running autohtseq.sh on all strains & temps
	- sort counts into tables (write bash script?)
- prepare for meeting with A
- ask W again about Illumina stranded library protocol
- wrote makecounttable.R to make a DESeq-appropriate count table

NEXT:
- do DESeq tutorial on BioconductR website

20-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- looking at DESeq2 tutorial
	- ask W to install Rsamtools and GenomicFeatures libraries
	- apparently you can run things in parallel? several tutorials online
	- might want to talk to Y about DESeq2
- ask W how to get latest version of R on local computer (want to use Rstudio
  for plots)
	- tried to add cran mirror to the sources list but was denied :(


23-03-2015
==========

TODAY:
- find out how to update R on work machine
	- got help from W
	- in future, use: sudo apt-get install <program_name>
	- for R: sudo apt-get install r-base
	- no need to add to sources.list if you just want a one-time update 
- continue with DESeq2 tutorial in Rstudio--> for plotting
	- also some problems installing some DESeq packages
	- W updated xml2 (another type of rich text format)
	- "GenomicFeatures" package still doesn't work...
	- managed to get some plots going from tutorial
	- need to read tutorial in more detail, esp. "Starting from Count Matrices"
	- need to read explanatory document
- think about Atwood talk
	- perhaps start from small RNAs...
	- thoughts in AtwoodTalkScrap.txt
- register for Math BioStats Bootcamp

NEXT:
- get ready for meeting with A
- reread tutorial starting from part about count matrices
- read DESeq2 explanatory document
- read more about small RNAs
- register for Math BioStats Bootcamp on Coursera
- think more about Atwood blurb
-
