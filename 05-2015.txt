TODAY:
- PICARD ReorderSam is done (apparently took ~12 min)
- talked with MB about stats & glms:
	- can suggest good textbooks!
	- explained glms
	- also suggested permutations/bootstrapping
- continued with variant calling pipeline for ED3092:
	> for file in *reorder.bam ; do PICARD AddOrReplaceReadGroups
	I=${file} O=${file/reorder.bam/readgroup.bam} LB=briggsae PL=illumina
	PU=1 SM=${file/-*/} ; done
	- apparently, this groups all reads into one new read group
	- this will add a new line to the header (presumably, it is necessary
	  to run GATK) with the LB, PL, PU, SM info
	- ED14-1 finished in ~20 min.
	- still running as of 17:03 (ED14-3)
- began reading Roff
	- left off Ch.2 p.13

NEXT:
- continue with variant calling on ED
- continue reading about stats

FUTURE:
- read up on edgeR: good option?
