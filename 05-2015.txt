TODAY:
- PICARD ReorderSam is done (apparently took ~12 min)
- talked with MB about stats & glms:
	- can suggest good textbooks!
	- explained glms
	- also suggested permutations/bootstrapping
- continued with variant calling pipeline for ED3092:
	> for file in *reorder.bam ; do PICARD AddOrReplaceReadGroups
	I=${file} O=${file/reorder.bam/readgroup.bam} LB=briggsae PL=illumina
	PU=1 SM=${file/-*/} ; done
	- apparently, this groups all reads into one new read group
	- this will add a new line to the header (presumably, it is necessary
	  to run GATK) with the LB, PL, PU, SM info
	- ED14-1 finished in ~20 min.
	- still running as of 17:03 (ED14-3)
- began reading Roff
	- left off Ch.2 p.13

NEXT:
- continue with variant calling on ED
- continue reading about stats

FUTURE:
- read up on edgeR: good option?

TODAY:
- continue with variant calling pipeline
	- replacing read groups done
	- began sorting at 10:51
	> for file in *readgroup.bam ; do PICARD SortSam I=${file}
	O=${file/readgroup.bam/sortcoord.bam} ; done
	- seems to be going very slowly from home... first 10 mil records
	  processed in over 2 min
	- had to abort:
		- failed to write temporary files, no space left on device
		- are temp files being stored locally?...
		- try again at work to see if same problem occurs
	- wrote to error files for WW to look at
- updated ~/scripts/commandline.txt up to middle of variant calling
