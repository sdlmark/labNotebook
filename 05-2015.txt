TODAY:
- PICARD ReorderSam is done (apparently took ~12 min)
- talked with MB about stats & glms:
	- can suggest good textbooks!
	- explained glms
	- also suggested permutations/bootstrapping
- continued with variant calling pipeline for ED3092:
	> for file in *reorder.bam ; do PICARD AddOrReplaceReadGroups
	I=${file} O=${file/reorder.bam/readgroup.bam} LB=briggsae PL=illumina
	PU=1 SM=${file/-*/} ; done
	- apparently, this groups all reads into one new read group
	- this will add a new line to the header (presumably, it is necessary
	  to run GATK) with the LB, PL, PU, SM info
	- ED14-1 finished in ~20 min.
	- still running as of 17:03 (ED14-3)
- began reading Roff
	- left off Ch.2 p.13

NEXT:
- continue with variant calling on ED
- continue reading about stats

FUTURE:
- read up on edgeR: good option?

==========

TODAY:
- continue with variant calling pipeline
	- replacing read groups done
	- began sorting at 10:51
	> for file in *readgroup.bam ; do PICARD SortSam I=${file}
	O=${file/readgroup.bam/sortcoord.bam} ; done
	- seems to be going very slowly from home... first 10 mil records
	  processed in over 2 min
	- had to abort:
		- failed to write temporary files, no space left on device
		- are temp files being stored locally?...
		- try again at work to see if same problem occurs
	- wrote to error files for WW to look at
- updated ~/scripts/commandline.txt up to middle of variant calling


04-05-2015
==========

TODAY:
- talked to WW about temporary file problem; moved location of temp files to
  somewhere with more space
- tried same command as before at 10:35
	- oops, forgot to logout first
- tried again at 11:15
	- seems to be working!
- continued with variant calling pipeline:
	- marked duplicates:
	> for file in *sortcoord.bam ; do PICARD MarkDuplicates I=${file}
	O=${file/sortcoord.bam/markdup.bam}
M=${file/sortcoord.bam/markdup.metrics} 2>${file/sortcoord.bam/markdup.err} ;
done
- tried to run PICARD BuildBamIndex but failed
	- not sure what it's for...

NEXT:
- ask WW about BuildBamIndex
- start GATK variant calling pipeline
- look up PICARD + GATK --> why?
- get talk together for Thurs


05-05-2015
==========

TODAY:
- WW investigated BuildBamIndex problem
	- looks like it might be solved with an update to Picard
- yes, functional .bai files now made
	- NB: you can't look at .bai files
	- to determine whether they are "valid", look at size
	- you'll know eventually whether or not they work once you go through
	  the pipeline
- started to run GATK
	- decided to realign reads that don't align well	
	- first, mark the intervals of bad alignment:
	$ for file in *markdup.bam ; do GATK3 -T RealignerTargetCreator -R
~/c_briggsae...genomic.fa -I ${file} -o ${file/markdup.bam/for_realign.int}
2>${file/markdup.bam/realign.err} ; done
	- GATK unhappy! will try just doing the variant calling without the
	  realigning (which shouldn't really be necessary)
- nope, GATK still unhappy
	- doesn't like N in CIGAR strings
	- how many reads have N in CIGAR?
	- might be a problem specific to STAR
	- however, GATK pipeline for RNA-seq recommends mapping with STAR
	- WW trying out GATK3 -T SplitNCigarReads

MEETING:
- discussed Harrison paper
- talked about conference-->make it broad, like 2 min talk
- play with edgeR for general analyses
- continue with variant calling
