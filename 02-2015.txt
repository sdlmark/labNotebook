==========
TODAY:
- set up git lab notebook
- set up script repository on GitHub
- learned how to generate SSH keys!
- wrote autobam1.py to automate conversion of SAM to BAM using samtools
- began running autobam1.py on AF16/starAF16/alignsAF16/ @ 17:07

NEXT:
- check that bam files are OK (and that autobam1.py is OK)
- if OK, try to run HTSeq on the bam files
	- first don't forget to sort them (can I pipe it?)
- make a list of commands and put them up on GitHub
